# ESP32 Water Management System

A comprehensive water level monitoring and control system built with React, TypeScript, and MQTT. This application provides real-time water level monitoring, intelligent forecasting, automated control systems, and manual override capabilities for water management infrastructure.

## System Overview

The ESP32 Water Management System is designed to monitor and control water levels in reservoirs, tanks, or other water storage systems. It combines real-time sensor data with AI-powered forecasting to provide proactive water management capabilities.

### Key Components

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous water level tracking via MQTT communication
2. **AI Forecasting**: Predictive analytics for water level trends and risk assessment
3. **Automated Control**: Intelligent gate, LED, and buzzer control based on water levels
4. **Manual Override**: Complete manual control when automatic systems need to be bypassed
5. **Historical Analysis**: Comprehensive logging and trend analysis
6. **Alert System**: Multi-level alarm system with configurable responses

## Features

### Water Level Monitoring
- Real-time water level display with percentage-based readings
- Historical data visualization using interactive charts
- Trend analysis showing rising or falling water levels
- Connection status monitoring for MQTT broker connectivity

### AI-Powered Forecasting
- 24-hour water level predictions using historical data analysis
- Weather impact assessment and seasonal trend analysis
- Risk level scoring (1-10 scale) with confidence percentages
- Proactive recommendations for preventive actions
- Action-required alerts for critical situations

### Control Systems

#### Automatic Mode
- Five configurable water level ranges with custom responses:
  - Critical (â‰¤ 10%): Emergency protocols
  - High Risk (11-15%): High alert status
  - Caution (16-20%): Warning protocols
  - Normal (21-30%): Standard operation
  - Safe (> 30%): Minimal intervention

#### Manual Override
- Complete manual control of all system components
- Gate control (Open/Close)
- LED alerts (Off, On, Blinking, Strong Blinking)
- Buzzer control (Off, Sounding, Beeping)
- Easy toggle between automatic and manual modes

### Logging and History
- Automatic logging of water level changes (threshold: >2cm difference)
- Alarm event history with timestamps and resolution status
- Action duration tracking for maintenance planning
- Exportable log data for analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **App.tsx**: Main application component with dashboard layout
- **useMqtt.ts**: MQTT communication hook with connection management
- **App.css**: Responsive design system optimized for desktop and mobile

### MQTT Communication
- Connects to HiveMQ public broker for real-time data exchange
- Subscribes to water level and system status topics
- Publishes control commands and status updates
- Automatic reconnection handling for network interruptions

### Data Management
- Local state management for real-time data
- Historical data caching with smart refresh mechanisms
- Log file integration for persistent storage
- Predictive model data processing

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun package manager
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd esp32-water-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

## Configuration

### MQTT Settings
MQTT broker configuration is located in `src/useMqtt.ts`:
- Broker URL: Configurable MQTT broker endpoint
- Topic subscriptions: Water level and status topics
- Publishing topics: Control commands and system status
- Connection parameters: Keep-alive, clean session, and reconnection settings

### System Thresholds
Water level thresholds and responses can be configured in the automatic control settings:
- Critical level actions (emergency protocols)
- Warning level responses (preventive measures)
- Normal operation parameters
- Safe level minimal interventions

### Logging Configuration
- Water level change threshold: 2cm minimum difference
- Log file locations: `log_nivel.txt` and `log_alarm.txt`
- Timestamp format: ISO 8601 standard
- Data retention policies: Configurable in system settings

## User Interface

### Dashboard Layout
The main dashboard is organized into six primary sections:

1. **Water Level Monitor**: Real-time level display with historical charts
2. **AI Forecast**: Predictive analytics and recommendations
3. **Manual Controls**: Override switches and manual operation buttons
4. **Automatic Settings**: Configuration for automated responses
5. **Alarm History**: Recent alerts and their resolution status
6. **System Status**: Connection monitoring and system health

### Navigation
- **Dashboard**: Main monitoring and control interface
- **Settings**: System configuration and preferences
- **Logs**: Detailed historical data and event logs

### Responsive Design
The interface adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Three-column layout for maximum information density
- Tablet: Two-column layout with reorganized components
- Mobile: Single-column stack for optimal touch interaction

## Operational Modes

### Automatic Mode (Default)
- System monitors water levels continuously
- Automated responses based on configured thresholds
- Predictive actions based on AI forecasting

- Emergency operation capability

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Water Level Categories
- **Critical (Red)**: Immediate action required
- **High Risk (Orange)**: Elevated monitoring needed
- **Caution (Yellow)**: Increased attention recommended
- **Normal (Green)**: Standard operation
- **Safe (Blue)**: Optimal conditions

### Alert Types
